### A Context-Aware System for Individualised Real-Time Pollution Mitigation During Cycle Commutes

Supporting code for Abi Langbridge's Masters' Thesis.
Consists of three parts:
  - Calibration of low-cost sensor against reference instrument (``/MY Monitoring``)
  - Monitoring of real-time commute exposure using mobile sensors (``/Commute Monitoring``)
  - Formulation of an optimisation for suggesting 'cleaner' commutes (``/Mapping`` and ``/Optimisation``)
